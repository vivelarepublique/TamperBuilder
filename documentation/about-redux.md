# Why I Stopped Using Redux for State Management in React (And What I Use Instead)

As a React developer, Redux was once my go-to solution for state management. However, over time, I found myself increasingly frustrated with its complexity and boilerplate code. After exploring modern alternatives like Zustand, Valtio, and Jotai, I decided to move away from Redux entirely. Hereâ€™s whyâ€”and what I recommend instead.

## 1. Reduxâ€™s Design Philosophy Clashes with Modern Needs

### A. Provider Hell and Boilerplate Overload

Redux requires wrapping your app in a `<Provider>` component to inject the global store, which feels similar to React Contextâ€™s nested structure. While this works, it introduces unnecessary verbosity for small to medium-sized projects.

Additionally, even a simple state update in Redux demands:

- Defining action types (e.g., `"INCREMENT_COUNTER"`).

- Writing action creators.

- Implementing reducers to handle actions.

- Connecting components via `mapStateToProps` or hooks like `useSelector`.

**Example of Redux Boilerplate:**

```javascript

// Action type
const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";

// Action creator
const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT: return state + 1;
    default: return state;
  }
};

// Store setup
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Component usage
const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  return <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>{count}</button>;
};
```

In contrast, libraries like **Zustand** reduce this to **5 lines of code**:

```javascript

const useCounter = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));

// Usage in components: No Provider needed!
const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useCounter();
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;
};
```

### B. Non-Responsive Updates

Redux relies on manual action dispatching and subscription-based updates. Unlike modern libraries (e.g., Valtioâ€™s Proxy-based reactivity or Solid.jsâ€™s Signals), Redux doesnâ€™t automatically track dependencies, forcing developers to optimize re-renders with `memo` or `useMemo`.

## 2. High Learning Curve and Cognitive Overhead

Redux introduces multiple abstract concepts that overwhelm newcomers:

- **Immutability**: Requires deep understanding of immutable updates (e.g., spreading objects).

- **Middleware**: Asynchronous logic needs extra libraries like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`.

- **Debugging Tools**: While Redux DevTools are powerful, configuring middleware and enhancers adds friction.

Modern libraries prioritize simplicity:

- **Zustand**: No middleware needed for async actions.

- **Valtio**: Mutate state directly (thanks to Proxy) without immutability constraints.

- **Jotai**: Atomic state eliminates the need for centralized stores.

## 3. Ecosystem Shifts Toward Lightweight Alternatives

The React community has shifted toward libraries that prioritize **developer experience** and **minimal API surfaces**:

| Pain Point | Redux Modern | Alternatives |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Boilerplate Code | High (Actions, Reducers, etc.) | Minimal (e.g., Zustandâ€™s **create**) |
| Provider Dependency | Required (`<Provider>`) | None (Store-first design) |
| Reactivity | Manual subscriptions | Auto-tracked dependencies (Valtio) |
| Learning Curve | Steep | Shallow (API fits in 5 minutes) |

Even Redux Toolkit (RTK), while simplifying Redux, canâ€™t escape its core design limitations. For most projects, lighter tools are more pragmatic.

## 4. When Is Redux Still Worth It?

Redux shines in specific scenarios:

- **Large-scale apps** requiring strict state traceability (e.g., time-travel debugging).

- **Teams with existing Redux expertise** and established patterns.

- **Enterprise projects** needing long-term maintenance and predictable upgrades.

For other cases, though, **simpler tools deliver faster results**.

## What I Use Instead

### A. Zustand

- **Why**: Zero Providers, mutable updates with Immer, and minimal boilerplate.

- **Best for**: Apps needing a global store without Reduxâ€™s ceremony.

### B. Valtio

- **Why**: Proxy-based reactivity feels like Vue/Pinia. Just mutate the state and let components react.

- **Best for**: Vue developers transitioning to React or fans of auto-tracking.

### C. Jotai

- **Why**: Atomic state avoids centralized stores. Perfect for micro-frontends or complex state graphs.

- **Best for**: Apps requiring fine-grained updates.

## Conclusion

Redux taught the React community valuable lessons about state management, but its design no longer aligns with modern development priorities. Unless your project demands its specific strengths, tools like **Zustand** or **Valtio** will save you time, reduce frustration, and keep your codebase agile.

**Give them a tryâ€”your future self will thank you!**
